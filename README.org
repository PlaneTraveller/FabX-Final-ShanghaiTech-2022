#+TITLE: The Game Inventor
#+AUTHOR: Huayu Wang, Jing Sun

/Note: this is my personal note. the final README should be a reorganized version of this./


* Prototype
** Game inventor
*** Structure
- theory of games: structure
- Design the game logic, not the assets
- cards, maps, indicators, rules
- information, iterator

*** Parts
- cards: Cell phone app
- maps: rear projection
- indicators:
** Problem
- anything graphical is hard to implement
- too many software
- no innovation

** Goal
- a platform that supports rapid development of new games
- Make the process of creation more enjoyable

* Iteration 1
** Fresh ideas
- use probabilistic distributions
- [[https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210318-the-ancient-invention-that-ignited-game-play][The ancient invention that ignited game play]]
- a game that allows overlap from different universes
- make the rules of individual "planes" verbose in all rule spaces (go pieces have hp, costs are normalized to turns, all rules projected into one big space)
- a ruleset of creating games
- Could be: a designing phase where players play a game to create a new game; a playing phase where players play
- Could be: normalization of different games into one universe, games played upon it
- ! a clock whose hands could be moved to generate reads

** Design
*** Story
- Elements: events(Actions, Catastrophies), game manager(random trigger), status board(Turn indicator, Token indicator)
- Sample scene: Begin with chess setup. Any player can skip their turn to perform an Action, with the cost of Tokens. The Actions have a 10% chance of failing, causing a Catastrophe. Random Catastrophies may happen at any time during the game, affecting only the player currently in turn. The games ends when one player's king is captured or certain Events happen.

*** Implementation
- digital counter
- timer
- randomizer
*** Parts
**** static pieces
- board, magnetic, piece,
**** electronics
- 2 lcd screens, 2 cons
**** software
- digital counter (changeable), timer (queries), language output
- chess clock, but with a twist:
- spending scores to do things
- random event
